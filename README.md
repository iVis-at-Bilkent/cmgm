CMGM is a unified complexity management framework for compound graphs.

## Description

Visualizing data as graphs facilitates the analysis of valuable information and the extraction of important patterns that are useful for the user. As the amount of the data increases, however, it becomes harder to manage corresponding graphs and focus on the desired parts. Several methods developed so far to manage the complexity of the large graphs work independently and hence may cause inconsistencies and falsy behaviors when they are applied in a certain order. In addition, applying these methods may cause drastic changes on the layout of the graph that will confuse the user breaking their mental map.

This project aims to develop a complexity management framework for effective analysis of big relational data represented as graphs by unifying various complexity management techniques to work seamlessly in cooperation with the proper adjustment of the graph layout after each complexity management operation to protect the user's mental map.
